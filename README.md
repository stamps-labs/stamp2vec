# Stamp-detection

This project aims to develop a system that utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize and classify stamps. The system takes an input image of a stamp and performs various image processing and machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize the stamp

## Introduction
Stamp recognition is a challenging task due to the diverse designs, sizes, and colors of stamps. Traditional methods of identification involve manual inspection, which is time-consuming and subjective. This project aims to automate the stamp recognition process using computer vision techniques.

The system is designed to identify and categorize stamps based on their visual features, such as colors, shapes, and textual information. It utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on large stamp datasets to achieve high accuracy in stamp recognition.

## Methodology
The stamp recognition system follows the following steps:

Preprocessing: The input image undergoes preprocessing steps for improving an image quality

Feature Extraction: The system extracts relevant features from the preprocessed image. 

Classification: The extracted features are used to classify the stamp using a machine learning model. This model can be a pre-trained deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), or a custom classifier trained on a stamp dataset.

Output: The system provides the recognized information about the stamp, such as its category, country of origin, and any additional relevant details.
