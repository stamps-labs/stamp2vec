# Stamp-detection

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a system that utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize and classify stamps. The system takes an input image of a stamp and performs various image processing and machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize the stamp.

The system is designed to identify and categorize stamps based on their visual features, such as colors, shapes, and textual information. It utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models trained on large stamp datasets to achieve high accuracy in stamp recognition.

## Demo

## How to use

The user submits an image of the document. The input image goes through pre-processing steps to improve image quality. The system extracts the relevant features from the pre-processed image. The extracted features are used to classify the stamp using a machine learning model. The system provides stamp information to the user
